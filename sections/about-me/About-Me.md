My geography began with high mountain walls in [Nelson, Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson,_British_Columbia).
Nelson is a small town of 10,000 people in the south-eastern corner of British
Columbia. It has a strong arts culture and attracts many affluent people
from across Canada and other parts of the world. Nelson supports forestry
industry, but acts primarily as a service center for the surrounding area.

After graduating high school in Nelson, I decided to pursue work
in Silicon Valley. With no experience or education, I simply stated my
value as willing to do anything that needed to be done, and do it to
the best of my ability.

I was given a chance by [Trickplay](http://www.trickplay.com/), which
has created a development platform for TV's running on existing
television hardware. I had the incredible opportunity at Trickplay
of being exposed to intelligent and experienced leaders. During my
time at Trickplay, I lived in Palo Alto along El Camino Real.

Nine months after arriving in Silicon Valley I met Brian Wong, a young Canadian
who had seemingly limitless energy and enthusiasm. This was a strong contrast to my previous
work, and I was very attracted to the youthful, though inexperienced,
leadership. After speaking with the other founders of the company, I
started at [Kiip](http://kiip.me) as the first non-technical
employee and moved from Palo Alto to San Francisco.

I was exposed to more than I could imagine at Kiip. My responsibilities
ranged from finding office space to doing front line business development
work. As I grew within the company I became close friends with a few of
the developers, who inspired me and tutored me in learning how to engineer
software programs.

Essentially, my experience at Kiip gave me the opportunity to work in an
vital operations roll in a startup that grew from 4 to 40 people in my time, raised
3 rounds of venture capital funding totaling $15.3M million dollars and
opened offices around the world.

In February of 2013 I left Kiip to pursue personal development, as well
as software development, by moving to Berlin, Germany.

I am currently available for web development work. If you're curious
