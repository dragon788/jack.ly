Briefly, this is me:

- I believe in business, and that successful businesses are built
by strong operators
- I am currently available for software consulting work (web, mostly)

If you'd like to learn more about me, read the [long version](/about-me),
or see some [projects](/technical-projects) I've worked on.

Strictly creative projects are documented in [skunkworks](/skunkworks).
