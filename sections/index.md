I am a software developer at [HashiCorp](https://hashicorp.com/).

We make and support software tools used by businesses and
hobbyists all over the world.

I have a bit of a blog at [pretengineer.com](http://pretengineer.com).

Prior to HashiCorp, I worked as an independent software consultant
focusing on application development and system operations.

In the past, I've lived in Berlin, San Francisco, New York and British Columbia, but
I am now located in Venice, CA.
