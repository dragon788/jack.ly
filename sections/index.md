I am a software developer at [HashiCorp](http://www.hashicorp.com/).

We make and support [software tools](https://hashicorp.com/products)
used by businesses and hobbyists all over the world.

Prior to HashiCorp, I worked as an independent software consultant
focusing on application development and system operations.

In the past, I've lived in Berlin, San Francisco and British Columbia, but
I am now firmly planted in the borough of Manhattan.
