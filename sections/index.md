Right now, I do software consulting for clients in Germany and The United States.

My work focuses on:

- Web and mobile applications, from deployment into various clouds to front-end JavaScript
- Improving developer workflow inside of companies
- Building maintainable tools to automate painful procedures on non-developer teams
