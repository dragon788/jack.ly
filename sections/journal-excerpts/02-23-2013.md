A bit about my departure from San Francisco.

> The next morning was rapid and effective. I shipped off my goods to
Washington State to be picked up by my mother, and sent my brother
some leftover clothes. The man from the UPS store below my house was a
great help in getting the 90lb box down from the 3rd floor.

> I then met Tyler, a friend who had offered me a ride to the airport very
kindly. We made quick time to SFO and I sped through security after
checking a bag.

> Then, a very funny thing happened at the gate for the seattle flight.
I was sitting looking about, as we were getting ready to board, and
an old man stepped in my direction and looked at me, smiling. I smiled
and nodded back, which led him to say, in rough accented but perfect
english: "Are you coming from Germany?". I was rather taken aback by this
of course, and exclaimed to him that, well, sort of I am, and that I would
be moving to Berlin soon. He smiled at that, and asked me in German
if I speak the language. I replied with no, maybe a bit. He said good day
in German and went on his way.

> My flight was quick to Seattle. I spent most of my time there sitting
at a caf√© called Zeitgeist. The young girl behind the counter, on
my second trip to the till, said "Oh, you're still here?".
