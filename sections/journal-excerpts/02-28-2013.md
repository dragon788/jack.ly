Leaving [Haida Gwaii]() after a fantastic trip.

> Evan cooked some eggs which I ate happily. Most of the packing was
complete, but some final bits were put together. Evan was packing as well,
he was on his way to Victoria, Vancouver, Nelson and Edmonton. He looked
forward to seeing his family and the town we grew up in.
