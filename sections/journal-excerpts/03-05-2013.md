Arrived in Manhattan before heading north on a train to Montreal.

> 8 hours later I was in the JFK taxi stand grabbing a taxi to my brothers
house in midtown east manhattan. I bust in the door, with the thud of
my bags, the star trek sound system rendering the digital signal of time
- 1:42am.

> Reks, on the floor, er, mattress, in his underwear, gave me a nod and
gesture of sleepiness. After some mucking about with my teeth I lay down
in the dark on my brothers couch. He was fast asleep, not to be woken
as he was destined for his alarm in a few hours.

> I lay there in the dark, in my underwear now, in the steaming
sauna that Reks describes as the "Bat Cave".
