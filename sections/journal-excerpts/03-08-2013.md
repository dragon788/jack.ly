French and English compete for seniority in Montreal.

> I'm staying in the Plateau district, on Mont-Royal Ave. Everyone here,
shopkeepers, strangers and neighbors all speak French as the dominant
language. I do not speak French. This makes communication a little less
graceful, and I catch and air of frustration from them as they switch
to English. This is the tip of the iceberg for my move to Berlin. There,
it will not be a bilingual nation I stroll around in.

> I am interested in learning if that same contempt slips through. This may
just be French culture imprinting itself here, that subtle rudeness (to
a north American).

> Trying to meet up with Nina for lunch right now. Hopefully she gets her
act together and wakes up soon.
