I decided to move into a very working class, normal neighborhood in
Berlin. I wrote this after visiting the upscale, more bourgeoisie
neighborhood known as Prenzlauer Berg.

> This brings me to a final conclusion of my inhabitance, and is that it's
initially challenging, and I remember with jealousy the streets I walked
upon earlier today, the english words carrying over the flow of footsteps.
