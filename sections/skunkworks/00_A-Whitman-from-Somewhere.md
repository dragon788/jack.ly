I wanted to share some Whitman (of the [Walt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman) variety) with my friends,
so I built a simple website to collect their addresses.

As I wander around, I'll mail off postcards to folks who want one.

There is no timeline, nothing precise. I connect to the SQL database
storing the addresses when I remember, and mail the cards when I feel
like it.

So, would you like a Whitman, from somewhere, eventually?
