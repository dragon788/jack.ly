Computers (yes, they are a collective) sell us a lovely vision of
being fast â€” we'll never have to pause again while doing work.

Unfortunately, this isn't true. Some things I make my computer do
take a few seconds to complete. This is valuable time that could be
spent thinking.

Ponder returns a quote. That's about it. It gives you something
to think about while waiting for a task to finish.

*Edit: I've been [made aware](https://twitter.com/paddycarey/status/354620831256686594) that [fortune](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_%28Unix%29)
is far superior. It's replaced Ponder for me. I'll keep it live and thinking, though.*
