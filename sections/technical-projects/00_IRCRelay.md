IRCRelay is a business that I ran with [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://twitter.com/mitchellh).

IRCRelay was a service that stayed connected to your IRC networks while
you were not, and upon reconnecting replayed messages that occurred in
channels that you had joined.

IRCRelay was a successful project that primarily served the developer
community.

I was responsible for the design and development of the web application for
marketing and user signups, the API for managing networks and configuration,
and more. Mitchell and I both contributed to support, and he managed and built
the infrastructure to communicate with IRC.

IRCRelay shut down in early 2014 so Mitchell and I could focus on other
endeavors. It was a hard decision to make and a lot was learned about
SaaS and the modern state of software services in the process.
