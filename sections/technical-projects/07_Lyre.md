Lyre was an application for sharing music on the internet.

When you uploaded a song, it read the MP3 ID3 tags, automatically
discovering the title and artist. It then stored the file and created
a unique page for the song to be accessed at.

Because of copyright concerns, the song was only available for a short
time (10 hours) after upload. After 10 hours, you were no longer able to
download the song.

There was built-in security to protect from crawlers determining the
direct MP3 link, and when that link was served to a user it was unique
to their visit to the song page.
