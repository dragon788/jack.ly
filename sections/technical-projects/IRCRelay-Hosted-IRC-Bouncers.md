IRCRelay is a business I operate with [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://twitter.com/mitchellh).

IRCRelay is a service that stays connected to your IRC networks while
you are not, and upon reconectting replays messages that occurred in
channels that you have joined.

IRCRelay is a succesful project that primarily serves the developer
community.

I am responsible for the design and development of the web application for
marketing and user signups, the API for managing networks and configuration,
and more. Mitchell and I both contribute to support, and he managed and built
the infrastructure to communicate with IRC.
