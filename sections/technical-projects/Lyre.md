Lyre is an application for sharing music on the internet.

When you upload a song, it reads the MP3 ID3 tags, automatically
determing the title and artist. It then stores it and creates a unique
page for the song to be accessed at.

Because of copyright concerns, the song is only available for a short
time (10 hours) after upload. After 10 hours, you are no longer able to
download the song.

There is built-in security to protect from crawlers determing the
direct MP3 link, and when that link is served to a user it is unique
to their visit to the song page.
