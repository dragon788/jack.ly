Wevther is a simple application that combines the Svpply API with
the weather in the city you're visiting the website from.

It uses a heavily cached version of products from Svpply associated
with specific weather conditions, and upon determining your location
through the HMTL5 browser location API or a zip code, connects the local
condition in your city with a set of clothing that fit the weather.

In practice, this allows you to discover clothes for purchase through
retailers relevant to the weather in your location.

Wevther was a fun way to demonstrate highly targeted marketing - the
days of spray and pray advertising are coming to an end.

I developed the Wevther backend for [Jacob Heftmann](http://www.jacobheftmann.com/),
who designed and created the website.
